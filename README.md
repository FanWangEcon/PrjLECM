# PrjLECM

This code repository provides a python package that solves equilibrium demand and supply problems with arbitrarily nested CES structure on the demand side and a supply side structure where indirect utility over alternatives is linear in log prices and shocks across alternatives are iid.

The code is used in [Benny, Bhalotra, Fern√°ndez, and Wang (2023)](https://fanwangecon.github.io/assets/UK_Flexibility_Gender_Wage_Gap.pdf).
