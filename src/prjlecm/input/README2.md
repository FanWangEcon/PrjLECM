# Model-inputs: Equilibrium nested-CES demand logit supply model parameters to dictionary

A nested dictionary to store all structures and parameters of the nested-CES demand and multinomial logit supply problem. 

There needs to be a way to communicate to the program the full structure and all parameters of the model. These are communicated as nested dicts. The model 

We have structures that:

1. Create these nested-dict-encoding of models with random data
2. Create these with non-random data based on estimation etc,
